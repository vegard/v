Contributing
============

While the project is Free Software (meaning you are allowed to modify and
distribute the code as you want), I would like to retain sole copyright in
my repository. This means that if you would like me to incorporate your
changes into my repository then you have to sign a Copyright Assignment
Agreement (CAA) first. The main reason for this is that I really would
like to retain the ability to switch licenses at will in the future. I
cannot anticipate all possible uses of the code or all the possible legal
complications that may arise from having multiple copyright holders.

One scenario in particular that frightens me is where we cannot move code
from the core compiler into the standard library because they use different
licenses (and if the standard library is covered by the GPL you wouldn't
be able to use it in non-GPL programs).

Another scenario is where we might make the compiler into a library that
can be linked with compiled programs (thus allowing programs to dynamically
compile/recompile code on the fly), in which case it would also need an
LGPL-like linking exception.

Keep in mind that by assigning copyright to me, I also retain the option
to license the whole codebase (modified or not; modifiable or not) to
somebody in exchange for money. I don't think there is anything wrong with
that per se, but I find it an unlikely scenario simply because the open
source project would still be open source and anybody could (still) fork
it and take over maintainership of their own fork at any moment.

I don't actually have a standard CAA form/document ready -- that is due
to lazy evaluation in the absence of contributors ;-) So if you're the
first potential contributor (who is not me), send me an email and we will
work something out.

All this is not to say that I don't want contributions -- on the contrary!
I would love for somebody to be interested enough in the project to take
an active role in development.
