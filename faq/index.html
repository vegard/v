<div class="section" id="what-s-wrong-with-c">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">What's wrong with C++?</a></h4>
<p>It inevitably leads to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vegard/satxx11/blob/master/include/satxx11/plugin_list.hh">code like this</a>
if you want to do certain things at compile time. (Yes, that is my code,
and no, I'm not proud of it.) In this case, I was trying create a
compile-time plugin infrastructure using the (at the time) new C++11
features such as variadic templates and perfect forwarding (before,
it would not have been possible to do this at all).</p>
<p>C++ templates are generally a train wreck. You cannot pass composite
objects (like struct or class instances) as template arguments; in
fact, you cannot even pass string literals or floating-point values.</p>
<p>Aside from all this, C++ generally suffers from the same problem as
C with regards to compile times (because the same headers are read
and parsed thousands of times over), except that C++'s templates
exacerbate the problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="is-it-v-or-v">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Is it V or v?</a></h4>
<p>I use "V" for the name of the language and "v" for the name of the
V compiler/interpreter (and its executable).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-the-name-v">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Why the name "V"?</a></h4>
<p>One-letter names are a staple of programming languages. I just wanted
something short (both for the compiler and the file extension) and V
(as well as the domain v-lang.org) seemed free. It's my language after
all :-D</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="is-there-any-connection-to-vlang-io-by-alex-medvednikov">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Is there any connection to vlang.io (by Alex Medvednikov)?</a></h4>
<p>There is no connection whatsoever.</p>
<p>My project started earlier (the first commit is from February 2017 and
has been available on GitHub since around the same time; the domain name
was registered in March 2017), whereas vlang.io does not seem to have
existed before February 2019.</p>
<p>The namespace of programming languages is a bit of a free-for-all
(there have already been a few other projects calling themselves "V" and
there's only 26 single-letter names possible after all!) and I don't
think it will cause too much confusion.</p>
<p>In any case, we are different projects by different people with completely
different goals and philosophies, and there is no ill will between us.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-is-the-difference-between-x-and-x">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">What is the difference between <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">@x</tt>?</a></h4>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> is evaluated at run-time, whereas <tt class="docutils literal">@x</tt> is evaluated at compile-time.</p>
<p>For example, given a function <tt class="docutils literal">fib(n)</tt> returning the <tt class="docutils literal">n</tt>-th fibonacci
number, you can <tt class="docutils literal">@</tt> in several different places for different behaviours:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal">print fib(10);</tt> — <tt class="docutils literal">fib(10)</tt> is evaluated and printed at run-time</li>
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal">@print fib(10);</tt> — <tt class="docutils literal">fib(10)</tt> is evaluated and printed at compile-time</li>
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal">print @fib(10);</tt> — <tt class="docutils literal">fib(10)</tt> is evaluated at compile-time but printed at run-time</li>
</ul>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">@</tt> is a prefix operator with low precedence, meaning that e.g.
<tt class="docutils literal">@print fib(10);</tt> is semantically the same as <tt class="docutils literal">@(print <span class="pre">fib(10));</span></tt> and
<strong>not</strong> the same as <tt class="docutils literal">(@print) fib(10);</tt>.</p>
<p>Note that macros are already evaluated at compile-time, which means you
don't need to use <tt class="docutils literal">@</tt> when invoking macros; for example, since <tt class="docutils literal">ptr</tt>
is a (built-in) macro, you don't need to write <tt class="docutils literal">@ptr(int)</tt> in order to
evaluate the type at compile-time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-the-juxtaposition-operator">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">What is the juxtaposition operator?</a></h4>
<p>What I call the juxtaposition operator is when you have two expressions
next to each other without anything in between, like this: <tt class="docutils literal">x y</tt>. The
parse tree for this is <tt class="docutils literal">(juxtapose (symbol x) (symbol y))</tt>. The slightly
unusual thing about this operator is that it is the only operator that
doesn't actually have a symbol.</p>
<p>The juxtaposition operator is most commonly used for function calls and
macro invocations: for example, <tt class="docutils literal">f(x)</tt> parses as
<tt class="docutils literal">(juxtapose (symbol f) (brackets (symbol <span class="pre">x)))</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Of course, juxtaposition is not always interpreted as a call; it depends
on the context. <tt class="docutils literal">quote x y</tt> is parsed as
<tt class="docutils literal">(juxtapose (symbol quote) (juxtapose (symbol x) (symbol <span class="pre">y)))</span></tt>, and
since <tt class="docutils literal">quote</tt> is a macro, <tt class="docutils literal">(juxtapose (symbol x) (symbol y))</tt> is not
evaluated at all. Similarly, the expression <tt class="docutils literal">if x then y else z</tt> is
a tree of juxtapositions, but only the outermost one is actually evaluated
at compile time (since <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> is a macro).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-are-the-language-s-keywords">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">What are the language's keywords?</a></h4>
<p>There are no keywords in V per se. What you typically see in other languages
as keywords are instead implemented using certain symbols defined as built-in
macros. I decided to do things this way for multiple reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>to keep the parser small and generic,</li>
<li>to allow the programmer to refer to and redefine the variables naming the
built-in macros, and</li>
<li>to allow the programmer to define his/her own "keywords" at will.</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, this means that you can reuse the syntax and the parser for
generic data that you want to store, i.e. something like this is completely
valid code and does not differentiate between "keywords" and other symbols:
<tt class="docutils literal">data := quote [if, while, return];</tt>.</p>
<p>Overall, I just found it more elegant to reuse the macro mechanism where
other languages have keywords.</p>
<p>That said, we do define a number of symbols such as <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">return</tt>, etc.
at the top-level scope. Please see the handbook for more information.</p>

<div class="section" id="compiler">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Compiler</a></h3>
<p></p>
<div class="section" id="is-v-a-compiled-or-interpreted-language">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Is V a compiled or interpreted language?</a></h4>
<p>Either and both.</p>
<p>In theory, you can interpret any "typically compiled" language (like C)
simply by first compiling the code and then executing the result. Similarly,
you could also compile any "typically interpreted" language (like Python)
by combining the interpreter with the to-be-interpreted source code into a
binary. Although both of these could be considered cheating a bit.</p>
<p>What you probably wanted to ask was whether the "v" program is a compiler
or an interpreter. See the next question :-)</p>
<p>That said, V is statically typed and so naturally lends itself to compilation
to fast native/machine code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="is-v-a-compiler-or-an-interpreter">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">Is "v" a compiler or an interpreter?</a></h4>
<p>Both!</p>
<p>Because you can evaluate arbitrary code at compile-time, you could view the
V compiler as an interpreter.</p>
<p>The top-level program that you pass to "v" is interpreted by compiling it
and then immediately executing the result of the compilation.</p>
<p>As opposed to e.g. C where functions are defined declaratively, in V they
are the result of actually executing code; when you pass
<tt class="docutils literal">f := function (a: int, b: int) { ... }</tt> to the compiler, this is not just
a fancy way of declaring a function, it is actually an assignment like any
other assignment, and it is compiled like any other assignment; <tt class="docutils literal">function</tt>
is a macro that returns a function pointer and <tt class="docutils literal">f</tt> is a local variable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="any-plans-to-make-the-compiler-self-hosting">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Any plans to make the compiler self-hosting?</a></h4>
<p>Not at this time.</p>
<p>Having a stable base language is important before writing any substantial
amount of code in it, and neither syntax nor libraries are currently anywhere
near finished.</p>
<p>C++ is already widespread and also makes it easier to build/install/bootstrap
on other systems/architectures.</p>
